# SOVOQ is an in-house 2D/3D/Game/App engine

This stuff was born during me peeking at some c++/opengl tutorials here and there. 
While i was working on my own 3D editor "CopperFX" i realised that i can make SOVOQ also as it shares
lots of concepts and contributes back to CopperFX. Also this development helps me broaden my skills in c++
in general...


Planned design features and some quick notes.

1. Standalone and libretro versions. All games/apps are just a collection of different resources, graphics, music and scripts.
2. 2D rendering sprite based subsystem.
3. 3D rendering PBR style sbusystem.
4. Virtual file system, mount folder, archive or .... whatever and you set to go.
5. IMGUI based resource editors.
6. IMGUI based debuging tools.
7. Python or Lua based scripting. 
8. GPU powered post processing.
9. 2D/3D particle systems.
10. OpenGL/Direct3D support.
